# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"

##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

      message: "🚀 PUT ENDPOINT IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETED AND FULLY TESTED: The newly implemented PUT /api/bills/{bill_id} endpoint has been comprehensively tested and verified working perfectly. COMPREHENSIVE TEST RESULTS: ✅ TEST 1 (Successful Bill Update): Updates all bill fields (customer_code, provider_region, full_name, address, amount, billing_cycle, status) with auto-set timestamps (updated_at, last_checked). ✅ TEST 2 (Update to CROSSED Status): Successfully changes status to CROSSED and automatically removes bills from inventory_items collection. ✅ TEST 3 (Recheck Scenario): Verified complete 'Check lại' workflow - AVAILABLE→CROSSED with full_name='khách hàng ko nợ cước' and proper timestamp updates. ✅ TEST 4 (Error Handling): Returns 404 for non-existent bill_id and 422 for invalid data formats. Response format matches specification exactly: {'success': true, 'message': 'Đã cập nhật bill thành công', 'bill': {...}}. The PUT endpoint is production-ready and critical for 'Check lại' functionality. All 53 backend tests passed successfully."

Auto-set timestamps working correctly - both updated_at and last_checked are set to current UTC time. Response format matches specification: {'success': true, 'message': 'Đã cập nhật bill thành công', 'bill': {...}}. Field updates verified: Provider MIEN_NAM→HCMC, Name 'Original Customer Name'→'Updated Customer Name', Address updated, Amount 1200000→1500000, Cycle 12/2025→01/2026. Timestamps properly set and returned in response."

          comment: "✅ TEST 2 PASSED - UPDATE TO CROSSED STATUS: PUT endpoint successfully updates bill status from AVAILABLE to CROSSED. Verified bill was initially in inventory (auto-added when status=AVAILABLE). After status update to CROSSED: 1) Status correctly changed to 'CROSSED', 2) full_name updated to 'khách hàng ko nợ cước', 3) amount set to 0 (no debt), 4) Bill automatically removed from inventory_items collection. Inventory cleanup working perfectly - bill no longer appears in inventory after CROSSED status update. This is critical for the recheck workflow."

Created AVAILABLE bill, then performed recheck update with: status='CROSSED', full_name='khách hàng ko nợ cước' (exact text from specification). Response verification: 1) success=true, 2) message='Đã cập nhật bill thành công', 3) bill.status='CROSSED', 4) bill.full_name='khách hàng ko nợ cước', 5) updated_at and last_checked timestamps set to current time.

TEST 4a (Non-existent bill_id): Returns HTTP 404 with proper Vietnamese error message 'Không tìm thấy bill' when attempting to update non-existent bill. TEST 4b (Invalid data formats): Returns HTTP 422 validation error when invalid provider_region enum values are provided. Error responses are properly structured and informative. The endpoint correctly validates input data and provides appropriate error codes and messages for different failure scenarios."
