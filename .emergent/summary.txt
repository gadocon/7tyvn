The trajectory chronicles an expert AI engineer's work on a full-stack CRM application, primarily fixing and refining its core transaction and customer management. The initial focus was a mandated refactor to a UUID-only architecture, which uncovered numerous 404/500 errors and data inconsistencies. Key issues involved misaligned frontend/backend data models (e.g.,  vs. ), missing API endpoints, and improper ObjectId handling. A significant part of the work involved correctly implementing a complex Đáo Thẻ (DAO) feature, differentiating between POS and Bill-based DAO, managing inventory for Bill DAO, and establishing a robust credit card business logic cycle for status updates and balance tracking. The engineer iteratively debugged and implemented solutions, including a custom business ID for DAO transactions and thorough database structure documentation. The latest work focuses on refining credit card data storage and ensuring unmasked card numbers are correctly handled.

The 7ty.vn CRM is a responsive mini-CRM for FPT/Shopee bill management, offering Dashboard, Bill Checks, Inventory, Customers (360° view), and Transactions. It uses JWT-based authentication with Admin/Manager/User roles and a modern glassmorphism login UI. The core problem has been achieving data consistency and robust transaction management.

Features and fixes include:
- **UI/UX**: Fix UI overflow, post-login navigation, login page enhancements.
- **Core Functionality**: Dashboard stats, inventory management, customer 360° view.
- **Transaction Management**: Analytics (line chart, filters, recommendations - pending), transaction export (pending), pagination (pending).
- **Critical Bug Fixes**: Numerous 404/500 errors, ObjectId/UUID inconsistencies, data synchronization, frontend-backend field mismatches.
- **Architectural Refactor**: Full UUID-only system for all entity IDs, unified inventory.
- **Database Management**: Clean/seed with consistent test data.
- **External Integration**: Webhook for bill checking.
- **Credit Card DAO Logic**: Implement Đáo Thẻ (POS and Bill-based) with proper status updates (, ),  calculation, and tracking bill inventory status (AVAILABLE/SOLD) for multi-bill DAO.
- **Custom IDs**: Implement business-friendly transaction IDs for DAO (e.g., D+last4+DDMM).
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive system, fixes, and business logic documentation.
</product_requirements>

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Full-stack**: FastAPI (Python), React (JavaScript), MongoDB.
- **UI/UX**: TailwindCSS, Recharts, Glassmorphism.
- **Authentication**: JWT, bcrypt, role-based access.
- **Asynchronous**: aiohttp, asyncio.
- **Data Handling**: Pydantic, MongoDB aggregation, UUIDs, Composite IDs.
- **Business Logic**: Credit card lifecycle, inventory management, transaction type classification.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application uses a monorepo structure:



- :
    - **Importance**: Python dependency management.
    - **Changes**: Added authentication, async, and JSON handling libraries.
- :
    - **Importance**: Core FastAPI application, all API routes, database interactions.
    - **Changes**: Major refactor for UUID-only system, composite bill IDs, comprehensive fixes for 404/500 errors, ObjectId serialization, authentication, and datetime handling. Implemented detailed Customer (list, detail, transactions), Bills (list, detail), Inventory, Sales, Credit Card (CRUD, DAO for POS/Bill), and Unified Transactions APIs. Includes complex aggregation for unified views and credit card business logic functions (status, available credit, next due date).
- :
    - **Importance**: Centralizes UUID/composite ID generation and validation.
    - **Changes**: Adapted for composite bill IDs and DAO transaction business IDs with auto-increment.
- :
    - **Importance**: Main React component, routing, UI logic.
    - **Changes**: Extensive fixes for API endpoint paths, data display inconsistencies (e.g.,  to ), React key warnings, null safety, and error handling. Refactored transaction type display, customer detail modal, and credit card detail modal to correctly map backend responses and integrate new business logic fields (e.g., card status, available credit).
- :
    - **Importance**: Frontend environment variables ().
    - **Changes**: Updated for correct backend domain.
- :
    - **Importance**: Database setup and test data.
    - **Changes**: Used to reset DB, create admin users, and generate consistent test data including UUIDs.
-  (NEW):
    - **Importance**: Documents the DAO business logic, transaction types, and flow.
    - **Changes**: Created to capture detailed DAO business requirements and implementation.

<pending_tasks>
- Complete  on the Customer Detail page.
- Implement  functionality in the Transactions tab.
- Implement  in the Transactions tab (full scope, beyond editing).
- Implement  to the Transactions tab.
- Implement  and  in the Analytics tab.
- Implement  (for revenue and profit transactions) in the Analytics tab.
- Fully implement missing  endpoints (e.g., , ) that were commented out in the frontend.
- Implement placeholder endpoints like .
- Implement the UI for selecting multiple bills from inventory within the DAO modal.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing two critical issues raised by the user regarding the credit card management system:
1.  **Redundant  field**: The user stated that  should be removed from the  model as it's not relevant for their business model (CRM for a service provider, not personal card management).
2.  **Card number masking in database**: The user emphasized that card numbers should *not* be masked in the database, but only on the frontend for display, to allow for editing and proper backend processing.

The AI engineer inspected the  collection and confirmed that  existed with values, but the  was still stored unmasked in the database, which was correct.

The work currently in progress involves:
-   Removing the  field from the  Pydantic model in .
-   Updating all related business logic functions (, ) in  to no longer reference or depend on .
-   Modifying DAO logic endpoints (, ) in  to remove any database updates related to .
-   Ensuring that the full, unmasked  is correctly stored in DAO transaction records, aligning with the frontend-only masking requirement. The last message indicates work on the General DAO endpoint to ensure this.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Continue fixing the General DAO endpoint to ensure  is stored unmasked.
