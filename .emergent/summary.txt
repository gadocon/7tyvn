The AI engineer has successfully guided the FPT Bill Manager application through significant development phases, driven by continuous user feedback and bug reports. Initial efforts focused on fixing critical bugs, such as incorrect external API mapping for bill checking and data integrity issues with bill deletion. Key features like a Add New Bill modal and comprehensive Import/Export functionalities were implemented.

Subsequent work heavily focused on the Credit Card Management system, including a visually appealing UI with real-time card previews, robust CRUD operations, and the implementation of complex banking-grade business logic for card lifecycles, statuses (Đã đáo, Cần đáo, Quá Hạn), and transaction tracking. A comprehensive activity logging system was also added to the Dashboard. The development process was highly iterative, with the AI consistently responding to user-identified bugs and new requirements, leading to numerous fixes and enhancements across both frontend (React with Shadcn/UI and TailwindCSS) and backend (FastAPI with MongoDB). The current focus is on resolving a UI bug related to modal reuse.

The FPT Bill Manager is a mini-CRM application for managing electric bills via FPT and Shopee. It features a Dashboard, Kiểm Tra Mã Điện for bulk bill checks, Kho Bill for inventory, Khách Hàng for CRM (CRUD, transactions), and Bán Bill for sales. The UI is 100% Vietnamese and responsive.

The project trajectory included these key requirements:
- **Core Bug Fixes**: Resolve  mapping issue, parse external API responses correctly, and fix  column in customer transactions. Address a critical data integrity bug allowing deletion of Đã bán bills.
- **Inventory Management**: Implement Thêm Bill Mới (Add New Bill) modal, Import/Export for Inventory, Customers, and Sales (Excel format with validation and filters). Enhance Kho Bill to display all (including sold) bills, add bulk selection, column sorting, and enable bulk deletion. Implement a Check Lại (Recheck) button for AVAILABLE bills, updating status to Đã Gạch with a Chuyển đơn cho khách hàng modal.
- **Customer Management**: Implement cascade deletion for customers, refine table headers (Tên for customer name, Số GD for transactions, hide Email). Enhance  with Mã GD, Mã Bill/Thẻ (showing  for credit cards),  date format, and hide Phương Thức Thanh Toán.

Implement CRUD for cards, link to customers. Develop a Đáo (Payback) functionality (POS/Bill payment methods with transaction recording and multiple payments per cycle), with a 7-day grace period for Quá Hạn status. Fixed aspect ratio for visual cards.

- **UI/UX Refinements**: General styling improvements, consistent Vietnamese UI.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing a bug reported by the user regarding the Dashboard's Recent Activities section. When clicking on a customer's name (which is presented as a hyperlink-style button), the system was opening a *new, separate modal* to display customer details, instead of reusing the  that already exists on the Khách Hàng page. The user explicitly pointed out that this behavior was duplicative and wasteful (bạn đang hao phí qtoken rồi).

The AI acknowledged this as a bug (duplicate modal) and stated a plan to fix it by removing the redundant modal from the Dashboard and properly reusing the existing  for customer detail display.
