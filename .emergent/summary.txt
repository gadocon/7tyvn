The previous AI engineer effectively continued the development of the 7ty.vn CRM application (formerly FPT Bill Manager) by addressing a series of user-reported bugs and implementing significant feature enhancements. The work involved fixing a duplicate modal issue on the Dashboard by refactoring  to a global, reusable component. The application name was successfully rebranded. A crucial bug in the bill selling activity logging was identified and fixed by the backend testing agent, ensuring sales activities appeared on the Dashboard. Most recently, a comprehensive responsive layout with a toggleable sidebar and smooth animations was implemented across all device types. The AI demonstrated iterative development, robust debugging, and effective use of a testing agent. The current focus is on resolving a UI overflow issue in the Khách Hàng (Customers) section.
