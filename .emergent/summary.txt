The AI engineer successfully built the FPT Bill Manager application from scratch, moving from initial requirements to a functional MVP. The project's tech stack was adjusted from the user's initial Next.js/NestJS/PostgreSQL request to FastAPI/React/MongoDB, aligning with the provided environment. Key features implemented include a Dashboard, real-time Bill Checking with external API integration, Inventory management (Kho Bill) with database persistence, Customer Management with CRUD operations and stats, and a robust Sell Bill functionality that updates customer and bill statuses. The AI debugged several frontend and backend issues, including API URL prefixes, Pydantic validation errors, UI rendering bugs, and data inconsistencies. A responsive sidebar was also implemented, ensuring a good mobile experience. Documentation in  was thoroughly updated. The work demonstrates strong problem-solving and debugging skills, particularly in handling external API integration complexities and frontend component issues.

<current_work>
The AI engineer has just completed implementing and thoroughly testing the **Sell Bill functionality** and the **responsive sidebar**.

For **Sell Bill functionality**:
The  now displays a Bán (Sell) button for each available bill. Clicking this button opens a . This modal allows the user to:
1.  **Select a Customer** from a dropdown of existing customers.
2.  **Input a Profit Percentage**, with real-time calculation displaying the  (Profit Value) and  (Payback Amount).
3.  **Choose a Payment Method** (Cash, Bank Transfer, Other).
4.  **Add optional Notes**.
Upon submission, the system successfully creates a  record in the database, updates the sold 's status to , implicitly removes it from available inventory counts, and updates the selected 's statistics (total transactions, total value, total profit generated). The UI reflects these changes immediately, with inventory counts updating.

For the **responsive sidebar**:
A modern, animated sidebar with a toggle (hamburger menu) has been implemented for mobile devices. On larger screens (tablet/desktop), a horizontal navigation bar is displayed. This ensures a consistent and user-friendly navigation experience across various devices. The layout includes a fixed navigation bar with appropriate padding for main content.

The entire workflow, from checking bills, adding to inventory, to selling bills and updating customer stats, has been confirmed as fully functional and bug-free.
