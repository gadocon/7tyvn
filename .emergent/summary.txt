The AI engineer successfully progressed the FPT Bill Manager application through several critical development cycles. Initially, it addressed a bug where a specific bill code worked in the backend but failed on the frontend, which led to a deeper diagnosis of external API rate limiting, incorrect provider mapping ( to  instead of ), and flawed backend response parsing. Once this core bug was resolved, the AI moved on to implementing the Add New Bill modal for manual inventory input, complete with backend API and frontend integration.

Following this, comprehensive Import/Export functionalities were added across the Inventory, Customer, and Sales pages, requiring new backend endpoints (including Excel generation with ), frontend UI/UX for file handling, and crucial bug fixes for FastAPI route conflicts (moving specific routes above  catch-all routes). The AI then tackled several UI/UX and data consistency issues, including making the Tất Cả Bills tab display sold bills, enabling bulk selection and sorting in the inventory table, fixing a JavaScript duplicate function error, and resolving a browser sandbox issue by replacing  with a custom modal for bulk deletion. Most recently, it implemented cascade delete for customers, updated customer table labels, and enhanced the transaction detail modal, though a data population bug for Mã Bill/Thẻ remains.

The FPT Bill Manager is a mini-CRM application designed to manage electric bills via FPT and Shopee gateways. Key features include a Dashboard for quick stats, Kiểm Tra Mã Điện for bulk bill checking using an external N8N webhook, Kho Bill for inventory management, Khách Hàng for comprehensive customer CRM (including CRUD operations and transaction history), and Bán Bill for processing sales and updating related records. The UI is 100% Vietnamese, uses Shadcn/UI with TailwindCSS, and features a responsive design.

The trajectory covered the following user requests:
- **Bug Fix**: Resolve the issue where bill code PB09020058383 (Miền Nam) failed on the frontend despite backend success.
- **Thêm Bill Mới Modal**: Implement a modal on the Inventory page for manual bill input, including fields like customer code, provider, amount, status, customer name, address, and billing cycle.
- **Import/Export Functionality**: Extend this capability across Inventory (import/export), Customers (export list + transactions), and Sales (export history), using Excel format with validation, preview, and filters.
- **Inventory Page Enhancements**: Display all bills (including sold ones) in the Tất Cả Bill tab, use real database data, add bulk selection (checkboxes), column sorting, and enable bulk deletion.
- **Customer Page Enhancements**: Implement cascade deletion for customers (deleting associated transactions and bills), refine customer table headers (e.g., Tên for Tên khách hàng, Số GD for Số giao dịch, hide Email), and enhance transaction detail modal with Mã GD, Mã Bill/Thẻ,  date format, and hide Phương Thức Thanh Toán.

<current_work>
The AI engineer has been meticulously working through a series of bug fixes and enhancements across the application. Most recently, it addressed several critical issues on the Customer Page and Inventory Page.

For the **Customer Page**, it completed the following:
-   **Cascade Delete**: Enhanced the  backend endpoint to automatically delete all associated sales, inventory items, and bills when a customer is removed. This includes a robust frontend  that provides a detailed warning to the user about the irreversible cascade deletion.
-   **Table UI Refinements**: Updated the  frontend to display cleaner table headers, specifically changing Tên khách hàng to Tên and Số giao dịch to Số GD. The Email column was explicitly hidden as per user request.
-   **Transaction Modal Enhancements**: Within the , the transaction table was significantly improved. A Mã GD (Transaction ID, showing last 8 chars) column was added as the first column. The Ngày Giờ column's date format was updated to . The Phương Thức Thanh Toán column was hidden. A new column, Mã Bill/Thẻ, was added, and the AI implemented logic to parse the associated bill code (e.g., TEST001) from the transaction's notes to populate this column.

Immediately before this summary request, the AI was debugging the **Mã Bill/Thẻ column in the transaction modal**, which was appearing empty. The issue was identified as a problem with the logic for retrieving and displaying the bill code from the transaction data. The AI decided to parse the bill code directly from the  field of the transaction, as it contained the necessary information in a consistent format. The user's last message confirms this column is *still* not showing data, indicating the fix applied in Chat Message 706 and tested in Chat Message 710 was incomplete or unsuccessful.
